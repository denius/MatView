=======================================================================

Installing MatView

1.  To compile MatView you will first need to install the following
additional software packages:

	* either TCL 7.4 / TK 4.0  or  later...

2.  Next, you will need to set the MATVIEW_ROOT environment variable
in your $HOME/.cshrc or equivalent shell startup file.  The value of
$MATVIEW_ROOT should be the directory where you have installed MatView,
as in:

	setenv MATVIEW_ROOT /home/me/MatView

3.  MatView now supports "configure" installation.  To create an
appropriate Makefile for your system, simply run:

	./configure

in the MatView directory.  Then you should be able to just run

	make

to build MatView for your system.  The resulting "matview" executable
will be placed in a subdirectory named for your system via the Unix
"uname" system command.  For example, for an SGI system, uname returns
"IRIX", for a PC running Linux it returns "Linux", etc...

For information on the various configure options, you can run:

	./configure -help

To run MatView, go into the subdirectory for your system and invoke:

	matview

Running "matview -help" provides a list of command line arguments.

Enjoy!
